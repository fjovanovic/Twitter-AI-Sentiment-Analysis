## Project info  
Employing Natural Language Processing (`NLP`) techniques, the project endeavors to construct a system for detecting hate speech in tweets. 
Hate speech is defined herein as tweets containing racist or sexist sentiments.  
The primary goal is to classify tweets as either containing hate speech (label '1') or non-hate speech (label '0').
