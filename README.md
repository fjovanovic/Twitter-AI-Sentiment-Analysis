## Project info  
Employing Natural Language Processing (`NLP`) techniques, the project endeavors to construct a system for detecting hate speech in tweets. 
Hate speech is defined herein as tweets containing racist or sexist sentiments.  
The primary goal is to classify tweets as either containing hate speech (label '1') or non-hate speech (label '0').  
For further exploration of the project and detailed insights into the dataset, interested individuals are encouraged to visit the project repository 
hosted on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arkhoshghalb/twitter-sentiment-analysis-hatred-speech).  
There, you can access additional documentation, code implementations, and the dataset itself, facilitating a deeper understanding of the project's methodologies and findings.

## Environment
- [Virtual Environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) (Optional but Recommended): Set up a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.
This ensures project isolation and prevents conflicts with other Python projects.
- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/): Consider utilizing Google Colab for running notebooks and experimenting with machine learning models.
Google Colab provides free access to powerful hardware resources, including GPUs and TPUs, which can significantly accelerate model training.

## Install dependencies 
To install project dependencies, simply run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This command will automatically install all the required packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file, ensuring that your environment is properly configured to run the project.
